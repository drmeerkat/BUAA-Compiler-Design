# BUAA-Compiler-Design
### 0x00 Introduction
Course work (a C0 compiler) for BUAA B3I063410 Compiler Design.  
Students will be required to design and implement a C0 compiler in 6 weeks, step by step. From lexical analysis, syntax analysis to semantic analysis (Quaternary mid-code generation included) and finally, to mips code generation and optimization.  
### 0x01 File Structure
- Source Code 
  - Final release version
  - No optimization version
- Documents  
  - My design thoughts
  - Software Documentation
- Test input  
  Some test programs
### 0x02 Usage
This is a Visual Studio 2017 projects, you could open it directly with VS17. 
Once you start the program, you could press <enter> directly to compile
 
After that, you could run the generated mips code with `Mars_refreshfix.jar`.
### 0x03 Thoughts
1. Start earlier and make your own plan !
2. Don't forget what you have learnt in class.
3. Review your design with pens and papers (debug from higher level) and don't rely too much on testing.
### 0x04 Acknowledgements
Many thanks to my dear friend @ohazyi, his project inspire me a lot.
Also, great work by Pete Sanderson (programming) and Ken Vollmar. Their [MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator (Mars)](http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/mars/papers.htm) runs smoothly.
